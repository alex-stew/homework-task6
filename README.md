<h1>Weather Application</h1>

<h2>Application Use</h2>
The weather app is an interface that uses APIs from Open Weather to integrate real time weather information based on user search input. 

In the center of the app you can click into a search bar and type any city in the world. The API willl then call the data and js will display the results for todays weather as well as a 5 day forecast. Any searches will automatically be stored in localstorage and on page refresh the last inputted city will be displayed.



<h2>Future Development</h2>
- ability to clear the buttons of inputted cities
- add logic so that if you search for a city that already exists in the array it is not added again
